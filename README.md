A compile-time framework for creating Minetest mods.

It gives you a DSL for declaring Minetest assets.
  These are compiled into the appropriate Lua definitions.

You can also use Racket's full power for procedurally generating assets.

There is minimal support for hooking into Lua code for runtime behaviour.

The goal is to make it as quick and easy as possible to get your art into Minetest.
